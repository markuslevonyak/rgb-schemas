## Catalog

This repository provides the following RGB schemata:

* __Non-inflatable assets (NIA)__.
  This is the simplest form of a fungible asset/token, which doesn't provide
  such features as secondary issue, ability to change asset name and
  parameters, ability to burn or replace the asset.

* __Unique digital asset (UDA)__.
  This is the simplest form of an NFT, which has one issuance of a single
  non-fungible and non-fractionable token with a representative attached
  media file and a preview.

* __Collectible fungible assets (CFA)__.
  This is the simplest form of collectible fungible assets.

* __Permissioned fungible assets (PFA)__.
  **Not production-ready**
  This is a fungible asset in which the issuer needs to approve every transfer.

* __Inflatable fungible assets (IFA)__.
  **Not production-ready**
  This is a fungible asset that supports *inflate*, *burn* and *replace* transitions.
